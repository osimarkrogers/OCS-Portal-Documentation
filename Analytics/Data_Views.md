Data views
You create a data view by defining the target namespace, the source stream or streams, the desired data fields, time period, and interpolation interval. The ability to create data views in the portal will mesh directly with OSIsoft's Data Science Enablement efforts, whereby users will be able to programmatically access Data View content via an API for the purposes of advanced analytics.

To create a new data view, complete the following:
1. Click Add Data View in the Data Views pane.
2. Enter the data view Name and Description in the Data View Information pane.
3. Click Standard or Narrow to specify the general shape of the data display.
4. Click the Add Query button in the Query Explorer pane.
5. In the Query ID pane, enter a name for the query in the Query ID field, or accept the default name. 
6. In the Query Type area, select Streams or Assets to indicate which this query is intended to search.
7. Type a portion of the name of any known stream or asset (preceded/followed by the * wildcard symbol)



in the Find Streams window, and click Apply to retrieve streams matching your criteria. Select the data fields, time period, and the interpolation interval required for the new data view. All streams or assets matching the query are displayed.

To set permissions for a data view, select an existing data view and then click Manage Permissions. You select Allow or Deny for each of the following permissions: Read, Write, Delete, and Manage Permissions, for each role you select from the Selected role drop-down list.

To edit a data view, select an existing data view, and then click Edit Data View.

To delete a data view, select an existing data view and then click Remove Data View.
